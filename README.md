This is a repository for programming books that we  have found useful when learning various topics in computer programming, cyber secuirty, and mathematics. 

These books are also from our respected universities that we find useful.

I try to update this repo as frequently as possible. If I find myself reference some text or website, it is posted on here for others to use and have.

Currently I am working on pushing the solutions I solved from the books. 

Other useful topics and helpful sources I use are located on my website at: www.bryanhsingh.com
