# Programming Books

## Bryan H. Singh

This is a repository for programming books that I have found useful when learning various topics in computer programming, cyber secuirty, and mathematics

I try to update this repo as frequently as possible. If I find myself reference some text or website, it is posted on here for others to use and have.

Currently I am working on pushing the solutions I solved from the books. 

Other useful topics and helpful sources I use are located on my website at: www.bryanhsingh.com
